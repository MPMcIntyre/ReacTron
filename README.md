A dynamic boilerplate with minimalist React, linked directly to WebPack and a custom hot relaoder for Electron. Keep your source code obscure by only publishing minified code, and add almost any package with an up-to-date webpack config. Bundled with scripts to ease prodution, such as source maps for development, but removal thereof when building to propduction. This boilerplate is tailored to keep the development environment as close to production as possible by completely mitigating a dev-server.
